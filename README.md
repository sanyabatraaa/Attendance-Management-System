# 📌 Attendance Management System  
### 🔹 Transforming Remote Work Attendance with Innovation & Technology! 🚀  

Remote work opens doors to flexibility, but also brings challenges—especially when it comes to verifying genuine employee attendance. To address this, my teammate **Yashik Khanna** and I built a robust **Attendance Management System** using the **MERN Stack**, aimed at boosting **accuracy**, **transparency**, and **accountability** in remote work environments.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **MongoDB** – Securely stores user data, attendance records, and captured images.  
- **Express.js & Node.js** – Powers the backend logic, including real-time image uploads and hidden location tracking.  
- **React.js** – Delivers a seamless and interactive UI for both employees and admins.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Live Image-Based Check-In & Check-Out**  
Employees are required to capture a real-time image to mark their attendance.  

✅ **Interactive Dashboard**  
Users can view and analyze their attendance history through visual graphs and tables.  

✅ **Absent Dates Overview**  
Clearly displays the dates an employee was absent.  

✅ **Admin Panel**  
Admins can monitor employee attendance, view their check-in images, and validate their physical locations.  

✅ **Hidden Location Tracking**  
Each attendance entry captures the user's location in the background—ensuring authenticity and preventing proxy attendance.

## 🎯 Benefits  
- Promotes **fairness** and **honesty** in remote attendance.
